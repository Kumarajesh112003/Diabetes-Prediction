DIABETES PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION\
=============================================\
\
Project Overview:\
-----------------\
This project is a binary classification model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes or not using logistic regression. The model is trained on medical data that includes key health indicators.\
\
Features Used:\
--------------\
The dataset includes the following features:\
\
1. age                 - Age of the patient\
2. hypertension        - 1 if the patient has hypertension, 0 otherwise\
3. heart_disease       - 1 if the patient has any heart disease, 0 otherwise\
4. bmi                 - Body Mass Index of the patient\
5. HbA1c_level         - Hemoglobin A1c level (indicator of blood sugar control)\
6. blood_glucose_level - Current blood glucose level\
7. diabetes            - Target variable (1: diabetic, 0: non-diabetic)\
\
Steps to Run:\
-------------\
1. Install required libraries:\
   - pandas\
   - numpy\
   - scikit-learn\
\
   You can install them using:\
   pip install -r requirements.txt\
\
2. Load and preprocess the data:\
   - Handle missing values if any.\
   - Standardize numerical features using StandardScaler.\
\
3. Train the model:\
   - Use `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.\
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).\
\
4. Evaluate the model:\
   - Accuracy\
   - Confusion matrix\
   - Precision, recall, F1-score\
\
Usage:\
------\
The model can be used to predict diabetes status given a set of medical attributes for a patient. It is useful for early diagnosis and screening purposes in clinical settings.\
\
Improvements:\
-------------\
- Add support for model deployment via API (Flask/FastAPI/Streamlit)\
- Collect more data or balance dataset if classes are imbalanced\
- Try advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost for better performance\
